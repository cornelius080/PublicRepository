## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```
flet run [app_directory]
flet run --web [app_directory]

## API

The main functionality of the app is handled by the following files:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application and sets up the initial page and navigation.
- `views_handler.py`: This module manages the different views (screens) of the application and their navigation.
- `bank_transactions.py`: This module generates random bank transactions for the "Movements" view.
- `faq.py`, `home.py`, `login.py`, `message_box.py`, `movements.py`, `other.py`, and `welcome.py`: These modules define the different views of the application.
